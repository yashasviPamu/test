I'm a complete newbie in developing apps with react native and it took time to actually understand and create an application. 
It's just a bunch of textinputs and text coupled with navigation for moving between home, login, and signup. I have added
phone number validation in Sign up page which is taken from 'https://github.com/garganurag893/react-native-phone-number-input'.
And other than that I haven't added anymore validations and the Welcome page just displays the phone number which you type in the 
Login page.
